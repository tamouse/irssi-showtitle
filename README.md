# IRSSI Script to show the title in a web page

This is an *old* script I wrote for us in the [irssi] IRC client. It
has a lot of controls and administrative functions to make it as good
a bot citizen on an IRC channel as possible, from completely ignoring
the channel it's in (supposing you're running it in your own instance)
to filtering in only certian URLs.

- [ ] TODO: add filtering OUT as well, see Issue [#1](https://github.com/tamouse/irssi-showtitle/issues/1)

[irssi]: https://irssi.org/ "IRSSI IRC client"

Documentation for the script is kept as perldoc in the script.

## Contributing

I haven't touched this really much in several years, but if you wish,
I'll accept PRs with bug-fixes and enhancements.

The code is still licensed GPLv2.
